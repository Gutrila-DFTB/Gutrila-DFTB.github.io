I started exploring technology as far back as I can remember. My first big fascination came with a **PlayStation 2** 🎮, spending countless hours on **Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 3**. That game didn’t just entertain me—it captivated me, it opened the door to a dream I still hold today: to someday be part of a video game’s development.
Years later, when we got our first computer at home 💻, I discovered a whole new universe. I spent hours experimenting with games like GTA San Andreas, pushing the game to its limits using mods, sneaking inside it's files and learning how it was created. That path led me to one of my favorite stages of discovery: setting up a local network for **Halo CE Anniversary** so I could play with my friends, on of the hardest but pleasent experiences ever ⚔️.
What started as simple fun even turned into a small family venture, where we ran a modest internet café ☕, each computer networked and loaded with the classic games of that time.

## My Beginnings in Programming 🖥️

In 2015 as my interest grew, I realized that behind every immersive game or website there was something deeper: programming 💡. That motivated me to create my very first website while I was still in school, using **HTML4** and **CSS3** a static page, simple and far from perfect, but seeing it live online was a turning point, especially knowing it was for a small family project we called **“Universal Publicity.”** That experience made me want to keep learning and building 🚀.

## My Studies and Experiences 🤖

My educational journey has been built step by step, and it hasn’t been easy. I started as a **technical** student, later advanced to **technologist**, then earned my **professional** degree, and finally completed a **specialization in Big Data**, 6 long yers. There were many moments along the way where things felt incredibly challenging—late nights studying, balancing responsibilities, and pushing myself beyond my limits—but with dedication and effort, I achieved each milestone1

On the professional side, I began my career as a regular advisor, however that was not enough for me, so, fter two years of hard work, learning every detail of the operation, and constantly seeking ways to improve, I got a promotion and decided to move into **Quality Assurance**, I felt strongly that working with processes, data, and metrics was something I was truly passionate about, and QA gave me the space to develop that analytical mindset.

Although I had to set programming aside for a while in my day‑to‑day job, I’ve never given up on the goal of moving into a role where I can apply my love for development and technology at a **professional level**, each step I’ve taken—both in my studies and in my career—has shaped me, and I’m ready to keep growing, learning, and moving closer to that dream.

## Content moderation and Possible Streamer 💡

At some point along my journey, I also had the chance to manage content on a **Discord channel** for YouTubers 🎧. Together with a small team, we acted as moderators—keeping everything organized, creating a great atmosphere, and helping others grow. It was an incredible experience, a place where I learned a lot about **community management** and **teamwork**, but it had to be paused due to some internal matters.

I’ve also always carried the idea of becoming a content creator or **streamer/YouTuber** 🎥✨. In fact, throughout my studies I recorded and edited several videos, like step‑by‑step tutorials on how to export a database in SQL Server, creating content allowed me to teach while reinforcing my own knowledge, and I loved it, I truly believe it’s **never too late** to pursue that dream—especially now with all the resources available online, it’s something I keep on the side but continue to work on little by little, and who knows… maybe one day I might even become well‑known 🌟

## Creating Impact with Technology 🌍

In 2020, with the COVID-19 pandemic, I observed the need in some local medical centers and decided, along with a group of friends including <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mmayradiga/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mayra Diaz</a>, to contribute our grain of sand by printing and donating 3D face shields. Little by little, the project grew and more people joined. Thus was born <a href="https://sdgactionawards.org/homemakersmexico/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hope Makers México</a>.

In 2021, together with another great friend, Guillermo Mora, we created <a href="https://devs.tizayocan.com/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Devs_Tiza</a>, a community for developers, designers, and technology enthusiasts. Our goal is to organize events, workshops, and mentoring to strengthen the local technology ecosystem.

## Sharing Knowledge 🧠

I've always liked **sharing my knowledge**. I often give small courses or mentoring to friends, students, or companies. When questions arise from them is when I learn the most, because sometimes these questions may seem simple and the answers are something we take for granted, but perhaps we don't fully understand why it is so. This pushes us to:

- Deepen our understanding of concepts
- Understand them better
- Transform them into something that can be taught clearly and practically

> Grounding knowledge is, for me, the bridge between knowing and teaching.

### Programming Mentoring 💻

From 2021 to the present, I have closely guided more than 15 high school students in the programming career. Taking into account that they are starting their education, when they reach the point of understanding how web pages are made, they begin with the most basic:

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript (fundamentals)

I have tried to teach them this in the way I would have liked to learn it at the time, obtaining excellent results, as concepts that weren't clear to them in school could be understood and applied following this different approach.

### Educational Content on YouTube 📹

Many of them were especially interested in frontend and wanted to better understand and master CSS. Therefore, I started creating small videos that I uploaded to my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@efeeledev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube channel</a> privately so they could consult them when needed.

In 2024, I recorded some <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FrontEndMentor</a> challenges with better quality and published them on my channel. Currently, I share these resources with people I know who are interested in the topic and want to learn by watching how it's put into practice.

Although there are few videos, I really enjoyed the process. Due to time limitations, I haven't been able to record more, as they require a lot of dedication, but I'm sure that **I'll soon be publishing new content**.

### Some of My Videos 🎬

Here I share some of those videos I've created to help others learn web development. Each one addresses different challenges and techniques that can be useful for those who are starting in the frontend world.

## What's Next... 🚀

In 2023, **Proyecto Tizayocan** was born, an initiative that seeks to apply technology to improve education, urban management, and connectivity in the municipality. This project is still in development, and we are gathering more collaborators to continue advancing.

At the end of 2024, after years working in the city council as **_Software Development Coordinator_**, and seeing the technological deficiencies of some municipalities, **StellarGov** emerges, a web components framework with Tailwind to help developers of small governments create fast and quality websites.

## A Bit More About Me 💀

Today, in 2025, I’m excited to start working in a field related to my background **_System Engineer/Big Data Analyst/Web developer_** any of those would be an awesome first step. In the meantime, I’m still collaborating with my current team, and my passion for learning and enjoying the process just keeps growing. I love creating things, experimenting with new ideas, and embracing that _little spirit_ of learning, exploring, and occasionally causing a bit of chaos. At the end of the day, everything feels right as long as there’s music and video games around. 🎮🎶

Oh! And I’m an expert at creating memes. Seriously—whenever the occasion calls for one, I’ve got the perfect template ready. Bringing laughs and smiles everywhere, so if you ever need a meme, I’m your go‑to person! 🪄

I'm **Daniel Felipe Tovar Bejarano**, and I do really appreciate your time for reading this.
