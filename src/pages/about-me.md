I started exploring technology as far back as I can remember. My first big fascination came with a **PlayStation 2** 🎮, spending countless hours on **Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 3**. That game didn’t just entertain me—it captivated me, it opened the door to a dream I still hold today: to someday be part of a video game’s development.
Years later, when we got our first computer at home 💻, I discovered a whole new universe. I spent hours experimenting with games like GTA San Andreas, pushing the game to its limits using mods, sneaking inside it's files and learning how it was created. That path led me to one of my favorite stages of discovery: setting up a local network for **Halo CE Anniversary** so I could play with my friends, on of the hardest but pleasent experiences ever ⚔️.
What started as simple fun even turned into a small family venture, where we ran a modest internet café ☕, each computer networked and loaded with the classic games of that time.

## My Beginnings in Programming 🖥️

In 2015 as my interest grew, I realized that behind every immersive game or website there was something deeper: programming 💡. That motivated me to create my very first website while I was still in school, using **HTML4** and **CSS3** a static page, simple and far from perfect, but seeing it live online was a turning point, especially knowing it was for a small family project we called **“Universal Publicity.”** That experience made me want to keep learning and building 🚀.

## My Studies and Experiences 🤖

My educational journey has been built step by step, and it hasn’t been easy. I started as a **technical** student, later advanced to **technologist**, then earned my **professional** degree, and finally completed a **specialization in Big Data**, 6 long yers. There were many moments along the way where things felt incredibly challenging—late nights studying, balancing responsibilities, and pushing myself beyond my limits—but with dedication and effort, I achieved each milestone1

On the professional side, I began my career as a regular advisor, however that was not enough for me, so, fter two years of hard work, learning every detail of the operation, and constantly seeking ways to improve, I got a promotion and decided to move into **Quality Assurance**, I felt strongly that working with processes, data, and metrics was something I was truly passionate about, and QA gave me the space to develop that analytical mindset.

Although I had to set programming aside for a while in my day‑to‑day job, I’ve never given up on the goal of moving into a role where I can apply my love for development and technology at a **professional level**, each step I’ve taken—both in my studies and in my career—has shaped me, and I’m ready to keep growing, learning, and moving closer to that dream.

## Content moderation and Possible Streamer 💡

At some point along my journey, I also had the chance to manage content on a **Discord channel** for YouTubers 🎧. Together with a small team, we acted as moderators—keeping everything organized, creating a great atmosphere, and helping others grow. It was an incredible experience, a place where I learned a lot about **community management** and **teamwork**, but it had to be paused due to some internal matters.

I’ve also always carried the idea of becoming a content creator or **streamer/YouTuber** 🎥✨. In fact, throughout my studies I recorded and edited several videos, like step‑by‑step tutorials on how to export a database in SQL Server, creating content allowed me to teach while reinforcing my own knowledge, and I loved it, I truly believe it’s **never too late** to pursue that dream—especially now with all the resources available online, it’s something I keep on the side but continue to work on little by little, and who knows… maybe one day I might even become well‑known 🌟

## Languages and the reason behind 🧠

When it comes to languages, **Spanish** is my native language, but I also learned **English** thanks to the internet—through videos, music, games, and countless hours of online interaction, that knowledge has opened doors in many environments, allowing me to communicate effectively and even act as a translator between my Spanish‑speaking friends and other friends who don’t speak Spanish, it’s been incredibly rewarding to help bridge that gap and connect people 🌐.

Over time, I also developed a deep interest in Asian culture 🌸—especially Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, to this day, I truly enjoy K‑dramas, Anime, and other media from those regions, baturally, after watching so much, some words and phrases stick with you, and I’ve already picked up bits of their languages, still, I’d love to focus on formally studying them 📚, since exploring new cultures and languages is something I find exciting and inspiring, in a tier list it wil be something like:

1. Japanese
2. Korean
3. Taiwanese

> Would love to work and live in any of these countries.

### Some of My fav Series 🎬

Here are some of the series between K-Dramas and Anime that completely caught my attention, each one explores different emotions and experiences, and I would definitely recommend them to anyone who wants to start exploring this amazing world.

## What's Next... 🚀

In 2023, **Proyecto Tizayocan** was born, an initiative that seeks to apply technology to improve education, urban management, and connectivity in the municipality. This project is still in development, and we are gathering more collaborators to continue advancing.

At the end of 2024, after years working in the city council as **_Software Development Coordinator_**, and seeing the technological deficiencies of some municipalities, **StellarGov** emerges, a web components framework with Tailwind to help developers of small governments create fast and quality websites.

## A Bit More About Me 💀

Today, in 2025, I’m excited to start working in a field related to my background **_System Engineer/Big Data Analyst/Web developer_** any of those would be an awesome first step. In the meantime, I’m still collaborating with my current team, and my passion for learning and enjoying the process just keeps growing. I love creating things, experimenting with new ideas, and embracing that _little spirit_ of learning, exploring, and occasionally causing a bit of chaos. At the end of the day, everything feels right as long as there’s music and video games around. 🎮🎶

Oh! And I’m an expert at creating memes. Seriously—whenever the occasion calls for one, I’ve got the perfect template ready. Bringing laughs and smiles everywhere, so if you ever need a meme, I’m your go‑to person! 🪄

I'm **Daniel Felipe Tovar Bejarano**, and I do really appreciate your time for reading this.
